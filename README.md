## Rationale

Choosing the theme "helping displaced people or refugees across the world get access to new skills, work and/or opportunities", for the Athena Hackathon 2022, Snack Overflow chose to create PetConnect, an app to connect pet families with those who have been separated from their own beloved pets due to displacement.

We wish to connect all sorts of pets to all sorts of people, helping to forge those emotional connections not just between people and pets, but between people and people.

A huge issue faced by displaced people is the loneliness that comes from moving to a new country, and hopefully bonding over pets can help alleviate some of the loneliness and help create a kinder, more caring, and more connected community.

## User Interface

### Design

We chose to focus on pictures and simple text as much as possible, aiming to keep the main functionality of the site clear to follow for those who are still learning to read English.  

Equally, we felt it was crucial to use mobile first design, as it may be that displaced people or refugees are unable to access a computer to browse the site.

### Colour Contrast

We used a dark background to increase the visual comfort of the user. With this in mind, we chose a forest green background on text elements, using white for the text colour to provide good contrast. This passes all tests for Large Text (18px/24px) on the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/607744/ffffff). We maintained font sizes of 18px and 24px where possible across the site.
